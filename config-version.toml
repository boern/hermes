# The global section has parameters that apply globally to the relayer operation.
[global]

# Specify the strategy to be used by the relayer. Default: 'packets'
# Two options are currently supported:
#   - 'all': Relay packets and perform channel and connection handshakes.
#   - 'packets': Relay packets only.
strategy = 'all'

# Enable or disable the filtering mechanism. Default: 'false'
# Valid options are 'true', 'false'.
# Currently Hermes supports two filters:
# 1. Packet filtering on a per-chain basis; see the chain-specific
#   filter specification below in [chains.packet_filter].
# 2. Filter for all activities based on client state trust threshold; this filter
#   is parametrized with (numerator = 1, denominator = 3), so that clients with
#   thresholds different than this will be ignored.
# If set to 'true', both of the above filters will be enabled.
filter = false

# Specify the verbosity for the relayer logging output. Default: 'info'
# Valid options are 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug', 'trace'.
log_level = 'debug'

# Parametrize the periodic packet clearing feature.
# Interval (in number of blocks) at which pending packets
# should be eagerly cleared. A value of '0' will disable
# periodic packet clearing. Default: 100
clear_packets_interval = 100

# Toggle the transaction confirmation mechanism.
# The tx confirmation mechanism periodically queries the `/tx_search` RPC
# endpoint to check that previously-submitted transactions
# (to any chain in this config file) have delivered successfully.
# Experimental feature. Affects telemetry if set to false.
# Default: true.
